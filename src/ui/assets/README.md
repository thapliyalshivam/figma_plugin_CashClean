# Logo asset

Replace `logo.png` with the PNG exported from Figma:

**Figma:** [Rebrading – node 1822:6558](https://www.figma.com/design/DxjyZhbaOubp10gOnTwxXW/Rebrading?node-id=1822-6558&m=dev)

1. Open the link and select the logo node.
2. In the right panel, use **Export** → **PNG** (or right‑click → Export).
3. Save the file as `logo.png` in this folder (`src/ui/assets/`).

Recommended size: 59×65px to match the header layout.
